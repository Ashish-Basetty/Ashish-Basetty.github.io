description: For fun over the summer, I taught myself OpenCV and how to build and train a YOLOv8 model through tutorials. I built a simple model that could translate sign langauge in real-time from a video, and trained it using data from my room. While it could be more accurate with hand pose detection or more advanced hardware than my PC's GPU, I am satisfied with the results and seems to work somewhat effectively given my dataset.
