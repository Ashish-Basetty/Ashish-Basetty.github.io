description: For my musical analysis project, I used data science and a set of around 60 songs to train a basic model to distinguish between rap, acoustic, and EDM music. It turned out to have a decent accuracy of around 75% for classifying new music from one of the three genres, and I also built a basic ML model to try and classify data. While the ML model didn't prove effective likely due to overfitting, it was a good experience in applying data science to a practical application.
